## Intro

### THE FEEDBACK SYSTEM

Major linux distributions will source to us linux questions and we will present
to the user when the feeback button is pressed

You use programming to hack stuffs, and you do it with Linux. You have learned
the minimalistic ways of the terminal and use vim do change your config files.
You share your code with git and think tmux is the best DE ever :D

You want a simple environment which will help you get things done.

## AD1

There are so many paths a developer can take because there are hundreds of
programming languages in use. In terms of ecosystems, your IDE can be VS Code
running on Windows, Xcode in MacOS or Vim and Emacs in Linux.

But this doesn't necessarily materialize for everyone. You might use Notepad++
or Notepad for simple stuffs. Or you might use Atom or Netbeans. Every
developer is comfortable with different tools.

Announcing [ 200 OK ], a keyboard-case for the Raspberry Pi family of
computers:

  - 77 keys
  - Intergrated power supply and power buttom
  - Headphone jack
  - Quick access to microsd

* - monitor is not included

# INTRO

    The [ 200 OK ] is a Linux Workstation, a full-featured* computer aimed at
    *learning* operating systems and programing.
                                                 * - HDMI display not included

    It has a 70% mechanical keyboard with 79 Cherry MX Blue keys, a mini HDMI
    port and micro Usb and power ports. Just like the old 8-bit computers like
    the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum.

    Its minimalist design was created to keep you focused on coding.

    It boots under 3 seconds (a bit more if you choose to setup GUI).

## The basics (almost...)

                                 What's included:


                           Mini HDMI-.         .-Micro USB

                    Jack    +-----------------------+

    Running at 170mA on peak CPU load, the BCM2835 is not a powerhouse.
    Fortunatelly you don't need much to shine with tmux or screen. Write
    code and markdown with vim, use git to clone your favorite code, surf
    a poluted-free web with w3m, automate your tasks with bash and more.

## Pi Zero

The Pi Zero W is a low power, general purpose computer that measures 65x30x5mm
and packs a 32-bit ARM11 SoC, the Broadcom BCM2835:

  * 1 GHz CPU (16K of L1 and 128KB of L2 cache)
  * 250 MHz "Video Core 2" GPU
  * 512MB RAM
  * Micro SD card slot
  * 2.4GHz 802.11n WIFI and Bluetooth 4.1 and LE
  * Mini-HDMI port
  * 40 GPIO pins

## Keyboard

In order to use the Raspberry Pi Zero W, we have created a custom PCB to house
the components for the keyboard (ATMega16U2) and audio out - since the Pi 0W
doesn't originally has a 3.5mm jack.

The PCB has headers to connect to the PI zero GPIO.

     79 keys

    Unix workstations previously had a big Control key where the CapsLock
    sits nowadays. They also had a big Enter key. The navigation keys are
    packed bellow the Enter, making the necessity to move the shift key
    (which was kept in a different place to maintain simetry).

    The navigation keys will end up being more important than having the
    right shift positioned in its old place.

    The keyboard colour scheme is for the student benefit.

    The function key is present to give another layer for accessing missing
    keys like Delete, Insert, PrtScr, SysRq, Home and End.

    The 60% keyboard doesn't have the top function keys and the 75% keyboard
    has a extra column after the Enter, which make things confusing. So we
    opted for a hybrid between 60% and 75%. It will be the width of a 60% with
    an extra row on the top for the function keys.

## Software setup

### Flashing, and activating ssh and wpa_supplicant.conf

    $ sudo dd bs=4M if=2018-04-18-raspbian-stretch.img \
      of=/dev/mmcblk0 conv=fsync

After finished, mount the fat partition and:

    touch ssh

    cat wpa_supplicant.conf <EOF
    example here

### LED

The Pi Zero's only has one LED, led0 (labeled 'ACT' on the board). The LED
defaults to on (brightness 0), and turns off (brightness 1) to indicate disk
activity.

If you want to turn off the LED on the Pi Zero completely, run the following
two commands:

    # Set the Pi Zero ACT LED trigger to 'none'.
    echo none | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

    # Turn off the Pi Zero ACT LED.
    echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

To make these settings permanent, add the following lines to your Pi's
/boot/config.txt file and reboot:

    # Disable the ACT LED on the Pi Zero.
    dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
    dtparam=act_led_activelow=on

### Help system

                  Alt + SysRq + b - reboot immediately
                  Alt + SysRq + o - halt immediately
                  Alt + SysRq + n - nice reset
                  Alt + SysRq + f - calls oom_kill
                  Alt + SysRq + u - read-only filesystems
                  Alt + SysRq + s - sync
                  Alt + SysRq + e - end all processes
                  Alt + SysRq + i - killall (really)

When shortcut is triggered, open a small pane, show the quick help and inform
the pane will be closed in 15 seconds.
